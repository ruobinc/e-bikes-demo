# E-Bikes Demo Script

## Context

E-Bikes is a manufacturer of electric bikes that distributes through a partner network of retail stores. This setup mirrors many of our embedded analytics customers who need to securely share internal data with external partners.

In this demo, you‚Äôll follow two personas:

1. **Mario** ‚Äì an E-Bikes employee managing partner relationships.  
2. **McKenzie** ‚Äì owner of a retail store selling E-Bikes products.

This walkthrough showcases both Analyst capabilities (Mario) and Business User features (McKenzie). You can follow the full story end-to-end, or jump to specific capabilities depending on your audience's interest.

## Demo Story

| **Scenario** | **Action** | **What to Highlight** |
|--------------|------------|------------------------|
| McKenzie logs in to check her store's performance. | Click the **McKenzie** tile ([jump to](/McKenzie/Home)) | Lands on her personalized home page. |
| She opens the **Product Catalog** dashboard. | Click **Product Catalog** in the header ([jump to](/McKenzie/product-catalog)) | Show how the dashboard is filtered to her store only‚Äîpowered by [User Attribute Functions](https://www.tableau.com/blog/unlock-power-personalized-analytics-user-attribute-functions). |
| She quickly sees which bikes are top sellers based on the number of $ signs. | n/a | The app uses the **VizQL Data Service** to programmatically access the same data powering the dashboard. The number of $ signs reflects sales performance. |
| She spots a spike in returns and wants more insight‚Äîtime to upgrade. | Click **Upgrade to Premium** | Demonstrates **monetization**: unlocking additional dashboards, more granular data, and features like trendlines, notifications, and YoY comparisons. |
| She notices subtle trendlines behind the bike tiles and explores further. | Hover over bike tiles | These sparklines are generated using **VizQL Data Service** and rendered with [Recharts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/recharts). |
| She also sees a red notification about returns and decides to dig deeper. | Click the **Analyze** link ([jump to](/McKenzie/Analyze)) | This is powered by **Pulse APIs**. The alert dynamically shows a relevant Pulse metric with a negative trend (e.g., returns or sales). |
| The pink theme is too much for a pre-coffee morning‚Äîshe switches to dark mode. | Click **Dark Mode** | Shows Pulse styling. |
| Digging deeper, she finds a specific battery type is driving returns. | Scroll to the Pulse metric ‚Üí Click **Breakdown** ‚Üí Filter by **Battery Type** | Notice how filtering by dimensions reveals clear root causes‚Äîin this case, a problematic battery type. |
| She wants to confirm whether this battery type also impacts sales. | Click on question Q1 (auto-seeded) | This uses **Pulse Enhanced Q&A** to correlate across multiple metrics. If no answer returns, move on‚ÄîQ2 offers another pre-scripted question, or type your own. |
| The Pulse analysis was great, but she wants to extend her search using conversational AI. | Click [AI Assistent](/McKenzie/ai-assistant) in the header | This uses **Tableau MCP Server** to allow the user to ask any question. The MCP Server sends a system prompt with the user question to the LLM, that has now access to the tools provided by the MCP Server. More specically, the LLM can now list the data sources in the site, find the fields in the data sources that can answer the user question, and query the actual data source. |
| Next, she wants to do some analysis on publicly accessible data to learn about the impact of accidents to inform here customers | Type in "Using the data source "Incidents, Accidents, & Occupational Safety", can you write an analytical summary of the impact of weather and location on the number of accidents" | This will use another data source (because the system template will use the e-bikes data source by default), and makes correlations using the data it can query |
| She wants to know the number of returns by battery type. | Type in "Show the number of returns by battery type by year" | You will see in the progress window that the LLM is using multiple iterations, and even correcting itself when errors occur, and using the different tools provided by MCP server to come up with the answer. The visualization in the bottom is using an open source charting library (rechart) to visualize the response of the LLM. |
| Concerned, McKenzie calls Mario to report the issue. | Click the profile icon (top right) ([jump to](/)) | Return to the login screen. |
| Mario wants to run his own analysis before taking action. | Click **Analyze** in the header ([jump to](/Mario/Analyze)) | A blank workbook opens, connected to the same published data source. Full Tableau authoring experience. |
| He uses **Tableau Agent** to quickly generate insights. | Click the **Tableau Agent** icon ‚Üí Click **Got It** ‚Üí Type: ‚ÄúShow me the returns by battery type‚Äù | Tableau Agent creates a viz summarizing return volume by battery type. |
| He identifies the issue: 300Wh batteries. He recalls a recent supplier switch and flags the issue internally. | n/a | Business user to analyst handoff completed with actionable insights. |
