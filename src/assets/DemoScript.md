## Demo Story

| **Scenario** | **Action** | **What to Highlight** |
|--------------|------------|------------------------|
| McKenzie logs in to check her store's performance. | Click the **McKenzie** tile ([jump to](/McKenzie/Home)) | Lands on her personalized home page. |
| She opens the **Product Catalog** dashboard. | Click **Product Catalog** in the header ([jump to](/McKenzie/product-catalog)) | Show how the dashboard is filtered to her store only‚Äîpowered by [User Attribute Functions](https://www.tableau.com/blog/unlock-power-personalized-analytics-user-attribute-functions). |
| She quickly sees which bikes are top sellers based on the number of $ signs. | n/a | The app uses the **VizQL Data Service** to programmatically access the same data powering the dashboard. The number of $ signs reflects sales performance. |
| She spots a spike in returns and wants more insight‚Äîtime to upgrade. | Click **Upgrade to Premium** | Demonstrates **monetization**: unlocking additional dashboards, more granular data, and features like trendlines, notifications, and YoY comparisons. |
| She notices subtle trendlines behind the bike tiles and explores further. | Hover over bike tiles | These sparklines are generated using **VizQL Data Service** and rendered with [Recharts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/recharts). |
| She also sees a red notification about returns and decides to dig deeper. | Click the **Analyze** link ([jump to](/McKenzie/Analyze)) | This is powered by **Pulse APIs**. The alert dynamically shows a relevant Pulse metric with a negative trend (e.g., returns or sales). |
| The pink theme is too much for a pre-coffee morning‚Äîshe switches to dark mode. | Click **Dark Mode** | Shows Pulse styling. |
| Digging deeper, she finds a specific battery type is driving returns. | Scroll to the Pulse metric ‚Üí Click **Breakdown** ‚Üí Filter by **Battery Type** | Notice how filtering by dimensions reveals clear root causes‚Äîin this case, a problematic battery type. |
| She wants to confirm whether this battery type also impacts sales. | Click on question Q1 (auto-seeded) | This uses **Pulse Enhanced Q&A** to correlate across multiple metrics. If no answer returns, move on‚ÄîQ2 offers another pre-scripted question, or type your own. |
| Concerned, McKenzie calls Mario to report the issue. | Click the profile icon (top right) ([jump to](/)) | Return to the login screen. |
| Mario wants to run his own analysis before taking action. | Click **Analyze** in the header ([jump to](/Mario/Analyze)) | A blank workbook opens, connected to the same published data source. Full Tableau authoring experience. |
| He uses **Tableau Agent** to quickly generate insights. | Click the **Tableau Agent** icon ‚Üí Click **Got It** ‚Üí Type: ‚ÄúShow me the returns by battery type‚Äù | Tableau Agent creates a viz summarizing return volume by battery type. |
| He identifies the issue: 300Wh batteries. He recalls a recent supplier switch and flags the issue internally. | n/a | Business user to analyst handoff completed with actionable insights. |
